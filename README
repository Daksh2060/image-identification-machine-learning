# Machine Learning Image Identifier

This is a project template from UC Berkeley, for a machine learning program that identifies images of numbers (0-9), extracted using optical character recognition. For this project, I have implemented the machine learning classification algorithms used to train the program and label the images with their corresponding number. The classifiers implemented were a naïve Bayes classifier, a perceptron classifier, and a large-margin (MIRA) classifier. These classifiers work iteratively on given training sets, improving accuracy by adjusting weights accordingly. 

## Classifiers

- **Naïve Bayes:** To be filled

- **Perceptron:** To be filled

- **MIRA:** To be filled
